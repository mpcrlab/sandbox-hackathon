## Theme: Unconventional and Natural Computing

### Overview

Join us for an exciting hackathon hosted by the Machine Perception and Cognitive Robotics Lab, where we push the boundaries of conventional computing with a focus on **unconventional and natural computing**. This year's theme centers around the challenge of generating random numbers, with an emphasis on maximizing **bits of entropy per second per dollar**.

### Hackathon Details

- **Date:** 
  - **Friday August 23rd:** Kickoff, Team Formation, Idea Jam

- **Thermal Computing:** Use temperature variations and heat flow to perform calculations, where thermal dynamics drive the logic operations.
- **Social Dynamics:** Apply principles of social interactions and human behavior modeling to computational systems, simulating social networks and group dynamics.
- **Color-based Systems:** Implement color patterns and variations as a medium for encoding and processing information, utilizing visual perception.
- **Quantum Computing:** Explore computation using quantum bits (qubits) where superposition and entanglement enable complex calculations far beyond classical computing.
- **Biological Computing:** Harness living cells and organisms, such as DNA computing or bacterial colonies, for computation, where biological processes perform calculations.
- **Chemical Computing:** Use chemical reactions to encode and process information, creating circuits and logic gates through molecular interactions.
- **Neuromorphic Computing:** Develop systems that mimic the neural architecture of the human brain, enabling energy-efficient and parallel processing.
- **Memristor Computing:** Utilize memristors—resistors with memory—to create non-volatile memory systems that can also perform computation directly within memory.
- **Mechanical Computing:** Revive mechanical systems like gears, levers, and pulleys for computation, providing a tangible and energy-efficient alternative to electronic systems.
- **Chaos Computing:** Exploit chaotic systems where small changes in initial conditions lead to vastly different outcomes, using chaos theory for unpredictable and complex computation.
- **Spintronics:** Use the intrinsic spin of electrons and associated magnetic moments for data storage and logic operations, enabling faster and more energy-efficient computing.
- **DNA Origami Computing:** Create computational systems based on the folding and binding properties of DNA strands, enabling nanoscale data processing.
- **Organic Electronics:** Employ organic semiconductors for flexible, lightweight, and potentially biodegradable computing devices.
- **Ferrofluid Computing:** Use magnetic fluids to create reconfigurable computing systems, where the shape and position of fluid elements perform logical operations.
